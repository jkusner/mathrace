CSE264 Final Project
"MATHRACE"
by John Kusner

DESCRIPTION
This is a multiplayer game where players race to answer randomly generated math questions.
Every player gets the same questions and answers, and the first player to make it through
the set amount of questions wins the game. If a question is answered incorrectly, a
penalty of one additional question is given to the player. This is to prevent button
mashing and winning by luck.
